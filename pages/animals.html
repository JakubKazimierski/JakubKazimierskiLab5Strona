                        Feed juveniles once a week, adults every one to two weeks.<br />
                        Feed in a separate tank so that your snake doesn't associate your hand or the habitat being opened with feeding.<br />
                        Fresh, clean, chlorine-free water should be available at all times in a large enough bowl for your ball python to soak in.

                        KING COBRA<br />
                        In zoos, these snakes are provided with a stable temperature, humidity, and light source.<br />
                        They are incredibly long snakes, and thus require larger enclosures than the average reptile might require.<br />
                        In a zoological setting it is extremely impractical to feed a diet of other snakes.<br />
                        Instead, these predators are sustained on a diet of thawed rats, mice, and chicks.

                        TARANTULA<br />
                        Tarantulas in captivity are very easy to feed and can live their whole lifespan on nothing but a diet of insects.<br />
                        Crickets are the most common food for these spiders.<br />
                        The majority of tarantulas require only one or two crickets to be fed to them per week.<br />
                        Some of the larger species can eat up to six crickets a week.

                        Feed geckos every day. Two to 10 insects per adult gecko is within normal eating habits.<br />
                        During growth spurts, baby geckos can consume up to 20 crickets at a single feeding.<br />
                        It is best to feed a gecko insects that are no bigger than the width of his head to avoid choking and prevent impaction.

                        MANTIS<br />
                        To house your pet praying mantis, you need an enclosure filled with appropriate substrate and some surfaces<br />
                        or branches for climbing and hanging.<br />
                        Make sure the enclosure of your pet is suitable.<br />
                        This means that the cage, box or terrarium is at least 3x longer than the body length praying mantis<br />
                        and 2x wider than the body length of the praying mantis.

                        CHAMELEON<br />
                        Chameleons spend most of their lives in bushes or trees, where they can hide from predators and wait for food.<br />
                        They’re unique among lizards because they have zygodactylous toes, meaning their feet can grip tree trunks and limbs.<br />
                        Their prehensile tails also wrap around branches to anchor them as they hunt, rest and eat.

                        There are a wide variety of species in this family of snakes<br />
                        and they are known to live in a number of different habitats across the world.<br />
                        Some species are found exclusively in rainforests, others are native to salt marshes and wooded areas.<br />
                        They can be found in dry scrublands, swamps, pine flatwoods, and more.<br />
                        They prefer areas dense leaf litter and debris, where they can hide effectively.<br />

                        Giant centipedes are voracious carnivores that feed on small invertebrates such as crickets<br />
                        worms, snails and roaches, and can also eat lizards, toads and mice.
